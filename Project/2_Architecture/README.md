## **COMPONENTS DESCRIPATION**

-  ###### Microcontroller
An integrated circuit that contains a microprocessor along with memory and associated circuits and those controls some or all the functions of an electronic device (such as a home appliance) or system.

- ##### ATmega32
The AVR microController is based on the advanced Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) architecture. ATmega32 microController is a low power CMOS technology based controller. Due to RISC architecture AVR microcontroller can execute 1 million of instructions per second if cycle frequency is 1 MHz provided by crystal oscillator.

- ##### Temperature and Humidity Sensor
The DHT11 is a commonly used Temperature and humidity sensor that comes with a dedicated NTC to measure temperature and an 8-bit microcontroller to output the values of temperature and humidity as serial data.

- ##### Soil Moisture Sensor
The moisture sensor measures the volumetric water content of the soil with the help of a sensing probe which must be put into the soil. The sensor module operates between voltages of 3.3 V to 5V. 

- ##### LED
Light-emitting diode (LED) is a widely used standard source of light in electrical equipment. It has a wide range of applications ranging from your mobile phone to large advertising billboards.

- ##### Relay Module
A 5v relay is an automatic switch that is commonly used in an automatic control circuit and to control a high-current using a low-current signal. The input voltage of the relay signal ranges from 0 to 5V.

- ##### 16X2 LCD
LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) is a type of flat panel display which uses liquid crystals in its primary form of operation. LEDs have a large and varying set of use cases for consumers and businesses, as they can be commonly found in smartphones, televisions, computer monitors and instrument panels.
