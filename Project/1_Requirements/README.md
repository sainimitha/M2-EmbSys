# **AUTOMATIC WATERING PLANTS**

## **ABSTRACT**
As we know that plants are the essential part of our life. Plants always need good care for their growth. Plants may not survive when there is any deficiency of nutrition in the soil and environment. So, through this project we will make our gardens take care of itself. In this project the sensor we have used monitors the soil moisture and air temperature of the plants and then automatically it starts watering the plant on the basis of the data received from various sensors in our project. Maintenance and monitoring of our plants and gardens are important. We have to maintain the plants regularly so that they can also be prevented from pests. That is why this project helps the garden care for itself if someone is not present for their maintanance.

## **DESCRIPATION**
Plants play a vital role in maintaining the carbon dioxide and oxygen in air. Many plants die due to urbanization. But apart from it plants also die due to lack of maintenance. Gardening is a healthiest hobby anyone can adopt. But they need continuous care without break. So the main aim of this project is to provide proper care to the plants. This project will also ease the gardening. It is built using AVR Microcontroller and bunch of electronic sensors.. In this project we have used soil moisture sensor for calculating the moisture in the soil .The controller is interfaced with the LCD display where it displays the data received from various sensors. The controller is programmed using embedded C.

## **ADVANTAGES**
- Just the right amount of water will be released.
- The water will be directed to exactly where it is needed. 
- An automatic shut off can help to keep water usage to a minimum.
